# odin-recipes

A small project for The Odin Project curriculum where you build a recipes application. The repository will contain a simple, well-organized codebase that demonstrates core front-end and/or full-stack skills depending on how you choose to implement the app.

## About this project

The goal of `odin-recipes` is to create a responsive recipe application where users can browse, search, and view recipes. You can implement this as a static front-end, a single-page application, or a full-stack app with a backend API and database. The focus is on practicing best practices, component structure, and delivering a polished user experience.

This README will evolve as you add features. Below is a short summary of what to include and the skills you'll demonstrate by completing the project.

## What you'll build

- A UI to display a list of recipes (title, image, short description)
- A detail view for a selected recipe (ingredients, steps, servings)
- Search and/or filtering by ingredients, cuisine, or tags
- Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
- Optional: persistent storage using a simple backend (Express, Rails, Django, etc.) or a serverless API

## Skills demonstrated / Self-reflection

By completing this project you'll practice and demonstrate:

- HTML, CSS, and responsive design techniques (Flexbox and Grid)
- JavaScript fundamentals (DOM manipulation, events, fetch/APIs)
- Component design and state management (if using a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte)
- Building and consuming RESTful APIs (for full-stack implementations)
- Basic routing and navigation (client-side or server-side)
- Accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, alt text)
- Version control with Git and writing clear commits
- Project structure, documentation, and incremental development

Reflection prompt: when you finish, write 5â€“10 sentences about what you found challenging, what you learned, and what you'd improve next (performance, tests, design, or new features).
